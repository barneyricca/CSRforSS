This folder contains code to produce figures for the text. You may notice that all of the plots look like they do in the Code Snippets except that a command like this:

postscript(file = "Figure 4.14.eps",
           title = "Figure 4.14",
           colormodel = "cmyk")

has been added before the plotting and the command:

dev.off()

has been added after the plotting.

For graphs and the like, encapsulated postscript is probably the best high resolution graphics format, so we use that. Because the files will be printed rather than shown on a screen, "cmyk" (rather than "rgb") is the appropriate colormodel.
